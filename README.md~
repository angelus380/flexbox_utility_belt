# flexbox_utility_belt

#flexbox is a wonderfull set of css properties that helps creating good responsive web-apps and is also adapted to most of the browsers.

#I've been working a lot with it lately and found out it was easier to use a css class with a single property and value of flexbox. So I'm making a style sheet with all classes that I'm using for my projects.

#There are several benefits in using this method, you can easily:
# - add flexbox with these classes in your HTML tags;
# - change them while working with DevTools for UI testing;
# - write only once all the properties, values and respective prefixes;
