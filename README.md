# flexbox_utility_belt

flexbox is a wonderfull set of css properties, it helps creating good responsive web-apps and is also adapted to most of the browsers.

I've been working a lot with it lately and found out it was less time consuming creating a style sheet with single classes for each flexbox property for future usage.

There are several benefits in using this method, for example, you can easily:
 - apply flexbox while writting HTML;
 - change classes while working with DevTools for UI testing;
 - write only once all the properties, values and respective prefixes;

Feel free to use the style sheet (it's in the CSS folder) and adapt it in your own accord.
I'll be adding more classes and some samples in future updates.
